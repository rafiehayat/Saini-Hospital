            <p>The Department of Urology at Our Hospital offers advanced urological care at par with international standards. We offer full spectrum of diagnostics and treatment for urology cancers, prostate diseases, laparoscopic urology, reconstructive urology surgery, stone disease, erectile dysfunction, paediatric urology, paediatric renal transplant and andrology.</p>
            <p>Urology is a part of health care that deals with diseases of the male and female urinary tract (kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra). It also deals with the male organs that are able to make babies (penis, testes, scrotum, prostate, etc.). Since health problems in these body parts can happen to everyone, urologic health is important.</p>
            <p>Urology is known as a surgical specialty. Besides surgery, a urologist is a doctor with wisdom of internal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology and other parts of health care. This is because a urologist encounters a wide range of clinical problems. The scope of urology is big and the American Urological Association has named seven subspecialty parts:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pediatric Urology (children&rsquo;s Urology)</li>
              <li>Urologic Oncology (urologic cancers)</li>
              <li>Renal (kidney) Transplant</li>
              <li>Male Infertility</li>
              <li>Calculi (urinary tract stones)</li>
              <li>Female Urology</li>
              <li>Neurourology (nervous system control of genitourinary organs)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The urologist will normally have notes from the referring doctor, but they will ask questions about the patient&rsquo;s medical history and carry out a physical examination.</p>
            <p><strong>They may also order some tests.</strong></p>

            <ul>
              <li>Imaging tests, such as CT scans, MRI scans, or ultrasound can help the doctor locate the problem.</li>
              <li>A cystoscope is a long, thin probe with a camera on that can be used to see inside the urinary tract, and, sometimes, to take a sample of tissue for testing.</li>
              <li>A urine test can check for bacteria or other signs of disease.</li>
              <li>A biopsy can check for cancer and other disorders.</li>
              <li>Urodynamic testing can check how fast the urine leaves the body, how much urine remains in the bladder after urinating, and how much pressure there is in the bladder.</li>
            </ul>
